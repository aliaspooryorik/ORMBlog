# ORMBlog

## What is it?

A simple example application demonstrating ColdFusion 9's in-built ORM features. 

The original tBlog application was created by Mark Mandel to demonstrate Transfer ORM 
which has been converted by me to work using ColdFusion 9.0.1 ORM.

## Installation:

- login into you CFIDE/administrator and create an new derby embedded database called 'ormBlog' (also works in mySQL, MSSQL).
- Extract the files into your webroot as /ormBlog/
- Run the application (it will build your database)
- You will need to create a user and a category before you can add a post

This is a very lightweight application, with very little in the way of error handling.
It is meant to simply be an example of some of the things that ColdFusion 9 ORM  is 
capable of.
